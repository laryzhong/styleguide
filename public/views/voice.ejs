    <h1>Voice & Tone</h1>
    <p class="voice-description">Voice and tone helps us focus and understand the way we say things and how our brand represents itself to the world in words. It also helps us achieve consistency of voice across the app/website/support/social etc, as well as consistency of tone/vibe between design and copy.</p>
